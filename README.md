# Base64EnDecoderGUI

A really simple GUI app for a really simple job!
Paste in plain text and hit encode, get base 64 encoded text out the other side (with optional URL encoding) or paste in base 64 endcoded text and get plain out, that's it.
I know you could do this with PowerShell or the C# interpiter in Visual Studio, but I found my self needing to do this often enough that writing this little exe was easier
and it probably will save me some time...in the end, probably just before I retire in 2045!
